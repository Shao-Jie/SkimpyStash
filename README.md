# SkimpyStash
A  key/value database based on SkimpyStash.
This idea is from this paper,"SkimpyStash  RAM Space Skimpy Key-Value Store on Flash".
This key-value dabase mainly uses hashtable.
It will be constructed by hashtable,bloom filter,cache component etc.

now I realized hashtable component, bloom filter component and write buffer.
